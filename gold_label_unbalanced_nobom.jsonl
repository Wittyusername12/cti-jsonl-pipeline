While we believe CosmicDuke to be an entirely custom- written toolset with no direct sharing of code with other Duke toolsets, the high-level ways in which many of its features have been implemented appear to be shared with other members of the Duke arsenal.","gold":null}

This assertion of time zone is also supported by timestamps found in many GeminiDuke samples, which similarly suggest the group work in the Moscow Standard Time timezone, as further detailed in the section on the technical analysis of GeminiDuke (page 23).

Both OnionDuke and MiniDuke also use date-based algorithms to generate Twitter account names and then searched for any tweets from those accounts that linked to image files. For most of the OnionDuke components we observed, the first versions that we are aware of were compiled during the summer of 2013, suggesting that this was a period of active development around this toolset. Further reading Artturi Lehtio; F-Secure Weblog; OnionDuke: APT Attacks Via the Tor Network; published 14 November 2014; https:// www.f-secure.com/ weblog/archives/00002764.html Further, the functionality of the OnionDuke variant is derived from a number of modules. In contrast however, for OnionDuke and MiniDuke the linked image files contain embedded malware to be downloaded and executed, rather than instructions. In fact, we saw yet another Duke malware toolset, OnionDuke, appear first in 2013. Like CozyDuke, OnionDuke appears to have been designed with versatility in mind, and takes a similarly modular platform approach. ONIONDUKE First known activity February 2013 Most recent known activity Spring 2015 Other names N/A C\u0026C communication methods HTTP (S), Twitter (backup) On the 14 th of November, F-Secure published a blog post naming the malware OnionDuke and associating it with MiniDuke and CosmicDuke, the other Duke toolsets known at the time OnionDuke first caught our attention because it was being spread via a malicious Tor exit node. OnionDuke gets caught using a malicious Tor node On the 23 rd of October 2014, Leviathan Security Group published a blog post describing a malicious Tor exit node they had found. OnionDuke\u0027s development therefore could not have been simply a response to the outing of one of the other Duke malware, but was instead intended for use alongside the other toolsets. Screenshot of a tweet intended for OnionDuke, with a link pointing to an image file that embeds an updated version of OnionDuke. The counter to that argument however is that the value of stolen credentials from users in the countries with the highest percentage of OnionDuke bots (Mongolia and India) are among the lowest on underground markets. The use of Twitter either to initially obtain the address of a C\u0026C server (or as a backup if no hardcoded primary C\u0026C server responds) is a feature also found in OnionDuke, CozyDuke, and HammerDuke. We have since been able to identify at least two separate OnionDuke botnets. What makes OnionDuke especially curious is an infection vector it began using during the summer of 2013.","gold":null}

{"query":"All of the 4 previously mentioned toolsets were written in a minimalistic style commonly seen with malware; MiniDuke even goes as far as having many components written in Assembly language. As researchers continued discovering new toolsets that were created and used by the same group that had been operating MiniDuke, the new toolsets were also given \u0027Duke\u0027-derived names, and thus the threat actor operating the toolsets started to be commonly referred to as \u0027the Dukes\u0027. As we now know, by February 2013 the Dukes group had been operating MiniDuke and other toolsets for at least 4 and a half years.

MiniDuke\u0027s rise from the ashes While MiniDuke activity decreased significantly during the rest of 2013 following the attention it garnered from researchers, the beginning of 2014 saw the toolset back in full force. Much like the MiniDuke expose in February 2013, the Dukes again appeared to prioritize continuing operations over staying hidden. Of these, the crucial one is the presence of PDB strings in the MiniDuke exploits. On the 14 th of November, F-Secure published a blog post naming the malware OnionDuke and associating it with MiniDuke and CosmicDuke, the other Duke toolsets known at the time Secondly, some of the MiniDuke components do not contain a hardcoded C\u0026C server address, but instead obtain the address of a current C\u0026C server via Twitter. The Dukes continued the expansion of their arsenal in 2011 with the addition of two more toolsets: MiniDuke and CozyDuke. The first observed samples of the MiniDuke backdoor component are from May 2011. This method is not unique to HammerDuke, as MiniDuke, OnionDuke, and CozyDuke all support similar use of Twitter (image 9, page 18) to retrieve links to additional payloads or commands. We are however only aware of one instance - the exploitation of CVE-2013-0640 to deploy MiniDuke - where we believe the exploited vulnerability was a zero-day at the time that the group acquired the exploit.

{"query":"Based on our investigations into OnionDuke, we believe that for about 7 months, from April 2014 to when Leviathan published their blog post in October 2014, the Tor exit node identified by the researchers was being used to wrap executables on-the-fly with OnionDuke (image 7, page 13). Both OnionDuke and MiniDuke also use date-based algorithms to generate Twitter account names and then searched for any tweets from those accounts that linked to image files. For most of the OnionDuke components we observed, the first versions that we are aware of were compiled during the summer of 2013, suggesting that this was a period of active development around this toolset. Further reading Artturi Lehtio; F-Secure Weblog; OnionDuke: APT Attacks Via the Tor Network; published 14 November 2014; https:// www.f-secure.com/ weblog/archives/00002764.html Further, the functionality of the OnionDuke variant is derived from a number of modules. In contrast however, for OnionDuke and MiniDuke the linked image files contain embedded malware to be downloaded and executed, rather than instructions. In fact, we saw yet another Duke malware toolset, OnionDuke, appear first in 2013. Like CozyDuke, OnionDuke appears to have been designed with versatility in mind, and takes a similarly modular platform approach. ONIONDUKE First known activity February 2013 Most recent known activity Spring 2015 Other names N/A C\u0026C communication methods HTTP (S), Twitter (backup) On the 14 th of November, F-Secure published a blog post naming the malware OnionDuke and associating it with MiniDuke and CosmicDuke, the other Duke toolsets known at the time OnionDuke first caught our attention because it was being spread via a malicious Tor exit node. OnionDuke gets caught using a malicious Tor node On the 23 rd of October 2014, Leviathan Security Group published a blog post describing a malicious Tor exit node they had found. OnionDuke\u0027s development therefore could not have been simply a response to the outing of one of the other Duke malware, but was instead intended for use alongside the other toolsets. Screenshot of a tweet intended for OnionDuke, with a link pointing to an image file that embeds an updated version of OnionDuke. The counter to that argument however is that the value of stolen credentials from users in the countries with the highest percentage of OnionDuke bots (Mongolia and India) are among the lowest on underground markets. The use of Twitter either to initially obtain the address of a C\u0026C server (or as a backup if no hardcoded primary C\u0026C server responds) is a feature also found in OnionDuke, CozyDuke, and HammerDuke. We have since been able to identify at least two separate OnionDuke botnets. What makes OnionDuke especially curious is an infection vector it began using during the summer of 2013.","gold":null}

{"query":"As will become evident in this report, this was not a one-off case but a recurring theme with the Dukes, in that they would rather continue with their operations as planned than retreat from operating under the spotlight. Based on samples of Duke malware from 2012, the Dukes do appear to have continued actively using and developing all of their tools. Based on this, we do not believe that the Dukes are replacing their covert and targeted campaigns with the overt and opportunistic CozyDuke and CloudDuke style of campaigns. Based on what we currently know about the targets chosen by the Dukes over the past 7 years, they appear to have consistently targeted entities that deal with foreign policy and security policy matters. But are the Dukes a team or a department inside a government agency? Campaign identifiers from 2009 also reveal that by that time, the Dukes were already actively interested in political matters related to the United States (US) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), as they ran campaigns targeting (among other organizations) a US-based foreign policy think tank, another set of campaigns related to a NATO exercise held in Europe, and a third set apparently targeting what was then known as the Georgian \u0027Information Centre on NATO\u0027. Concurrently with the alterations to CosmicDuke, the Dukes were also hard at work modifying their trusted loader. Continuing expansion of the Dukes arsenal By 2011, the Dukes had already developed at least 3 distinct malware toolsets, including a plethora of supporting components such as loaders and persistence modules. During the rest of 2014 and the spring of 2015, the Dukes continued making similar evasionfocused modifications to CosmicDuke, as well as experimenting with ways to obfuscate the loader. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Dukes are a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized cyberespionage group that we believe has been working for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect intelligence in support of foreign and security policy decision-making. Even though the Dukes appear to have targeted governments all over the world, we are unaware of them ever targeting the Russian government. Finally, it is worth noting that the Dukes are known to sometimes re-infect a victim of one of their malware tools with another one of their tools. Firstly, the Dukes may have been confident enough in their own abilities (and in the slowness of their opponents to react to new threats) that they did not care if their targets may already be on the lookout for anyone exploiting these vulnerabilities. For the victims deemed interesting enough, the Dukes would then deploy a different toolset. Further reading FireEye; HAMMERTOSS: Stealthy Tactics Define a Russian Cyber Threat Group; published July 2015; https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/848-DID-242/ images/rpt-apt29-hammertoss.pdf * *APT29 is the name used by FireEye to identify the cyberespionagegroup we refer to as the Dukes. INFECTION VECTORS The Dukes primarily use spear-phishing emails when attempting to infect victims with their malware. If however by that time the Dukes are already operating within the victim\u0027s network, using an another toolset with different IOCs, then it is reasonable to assume that it will take much longer for the victim organization to notice the infiltration. If the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the toolset used and move to using stealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise and long-term intelligence gathering. In one of their more intriguing cases, the Dukes have appeared to also target entities involved in the trafficking of illegal drugs. In some cases, the Dukes appear to have used previously compromised victims to send new spear-phishing emails to other targets. In the most extreme case, the Dukes continued with their July 2015 CloudDuke campaign even after their activity had been outed by multiple security vendors. In this case, the Dukes first attempted to infect large numbers of potential targets with CozyDuke (and in a more obvious manner than previously seen). Instead, we feel the targeting of drug dealers was a new task for a subset of the Dukes group, possibly due to the drug trade\u0027s relevance to security policy issues. It is therefore important to note that, contrary to what might be assumed, we have actually observed a drop instead of an increase in Ukraine-related campaigns from the Dukes following the country\u0027s political crisis. John Kasai of Klagenfurt, Austria During 2011, the Dukes appear to have significantly expanded both their arsenal of malware toolsets and their C\u0026C infrastructure. Much like the MiniDuke expose in February 2013, the Dukes again appeared to prioritize continuing operations over staying hidden. One might argue that since this took place after the exploits were publicly mentioned, the Dukes simply copied them. Right - Details for the domain were later changed, providing a small glimpse of the Dukes\u0027 sense of humor. The Dukes actively targeted Ukraine before the crisis, at a time when Russia was still weighing her options, but once Russia moved from diplomacy to direct action, Ukraine was no longer relevant to the Dukes in the same way. The Dukes continued the expansion of their arsenal in 2011 with the addition of two more toolsets: MiniDuke and CozyDuke. The Dukes have consistently operated large-scale campaigns against high-profile targets while concurrently engaging in smaller, more targeted campaigns with apparent coordination and no evidence of unintentional overlap or operational clashes. The Dukes primarily target Western governments and related organizations, such as government ministries and agencies, political think tanks, and governmental subcontractors. The Dukes rapidly react to research being published about their toolsets and operations. The earliest activity we have been able to definitively attribute to the Dukes are two PinchDuke campaigns from November 2008. The only instances which we are aware of where the Dukes did not use spear-phishing as the initial infection vector is with certain OnionDuke variants. The story of the Dukes, as it is currently known, begins with a malware toolset that we call PinchDuke. This does however still rule out the possibility that the Dukes simply obtained copies of the exploit binaries described by FireEye and repurposed them. This indication that the Dukes planned to use an arsenal of 5 malware toolsets in parallel suggests that they were operating with both significant resources and capacity. This paper has already stated that we believe the Dukes to be a Russian state-sponsored cyberespionage operation. This supports our analysis that the overarching theme in the Dukes\u0027 targeting is the collection of intelligence to support diplomatic efforts. This whitepaper explores the tools - such as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, etc- of the Dukes, a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized cyberespionage group that we believe has been working for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect intelligence in support of foreign and security policy decision-making. To spread the toolset, the Dukes used a wrapper to combine OnionDuke with legitimate applications, created torrent files containing these trojanized applications, then uploaded them to websites hosting torrent files (image 4, above). We also believe the tasking to have been temporary, because we have not observed any further similar targeting from the Dukes after the spring of 2014. We therefore believe that the Dukes group simply failed to update the computer they were using to compile GeminiDuke samples, so that the timestamps seen in later samples still appear to follow the old definition of Moscow Standard Time.","gold":null}

This neatly ties together many of the tools used by the Dukes group, as versions of this one loader have been used to load malware from three different Dukes-related toolsets - CosmicDuke, PinchDuke, and MiniDuke - over the course of five years. To avoid confusion however, we have decided to continue referring to the loader as the \u0027MiniDuke loader\u0027. While the loader has often been used together with other MiniDuke components, it has also commonly been used in conjunction with CosmicDuke and PinchDuke.","gold":null}

{"query":"Another is a loader variant seen during the spring of 2010 in conjunction with both CosmicDuke and PinchDuke. Much like the CosmicDuke toolset, the loader used by both MiniDuke and CosmicDuke had previously only undergone one major update (the Nemesis Gemina upgrade) since the first known samples from 2010. The GeminiDuke infostealer has occasionally been wrapped with a loader that appears to be unique to GeminiDuke and has never been observed being used with any of the other Duke toolsets. The loader used by the sample purported to have been compiled on the 25 th of March 2010. These resulted in a loader version that would later become known as the \u0027Nemesis Gemina loader\u0027 due to PDB strings found in many of the samples. They could have ceased all use of CosmicDuke (at least until they had developed a new loader) or retired it entirely, since they still had other toolsets available. This neatly ties together many of the tools used by the Dukes group, as versions of this one loader have been used to load malware from three different Dukes-related toolsets - CosmicDuke, PinchDuke, and MiniDuke - over the course of five years. To avoid confusion however, we have decided to continue referring to the loader as the \u0027MiniDuke loader\u0027.

{"query":"As will become evident in this report, this was not a one-off case but a recurring theme with the Dukes, in that they would rather continue with their operations as planned than retreat from operating under the spotlight. Based on samples of Duke malware from 2012, the Dukes do appear to have continued actively using and developing all of their tools. Based on this, we do not believe that the Dukes are replacing their covert and targeted campaigns with the overt and opportunistic CozyDuke and CloudDuke style of campaigns. Based on what we currently know about the targets chosen by the Dukes over the past 7 years, they appear to have consistently targeted entities that deal with foreign policy and security policy matters. But are the Dukes a team or a department inside a government agency? Campaign identifiers from 2009 also reveal that by that time, the Dukes were already actively interested in political matters related to the United States (US) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), as they ran campaigns targeting (among other organizations) a US-based foreign policy think tank, another set of campaigns related to a NATO exercise held in Europe, and a third set apparently targeting what was then known as the Georgian \u0027Information Centre on NATO\u0027. Concurrently with the alterations to CosmicDuke, the Dukes were also hard at work modifying their trusted loader. Continuing expansion of the Dukes arsenal By 2011, the Dukes had already developed at least 3 distinct malware toolsets, including a plethora of supporting components such as loaders and persistence modules. During the rest of 2014 and the spring of 2015, the Dukes continued making similar evasionfocused modifications to CosmicDuke, as well as experimenting with ways to obfuscate the loader. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Dukes are a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized cyberespionage group that we believe has been working for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect intelligence in support of foreign and security policy decision-making. Even though the Dukes appear to have targeted governments all over the world, we are unaware of them ever targeting the Russian government. Finally, it is worth noting that the Dukes are known to sometimes re-infect a victim of one of their malware tools with another one of their tools. Firstly, the Dukes may have been confident enough in their own abilities (and in the slowness of their opponents to react to new threats) that they did not care if their targets may already be on the lookout for anyone exploiting these vulnerabilities. For the victims deemed interesting enough, the Dukes would then deploy a different toolset.

INFECTION VECTORS The Dukes primarily use spear-phishing emails when attempting to infect victims with their malware. If however by that time the Dukes are already operating within the victim\u0027s network, using an another toolset with different IOCs, then it is reasonable to assume that it will take much longer for the victim organization to notice the infiltration. If the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the toolset used and move to using stealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise and long-term intelligence gathering. In one of their more intriguing cases, the Dukes have appeared to also target entities involved in the trafficking of illegal drugs. In some cases, the Dukes appear to have used previously compromised victims to send new spear-phishing emails to other targets. In the most extreme case, the Dukes continued with their July 2015 CloudDuke campaign even after their activity had been outed by multiple security vendors. In this case, the Dukes first attempted to infect large numbers of potential targets with CozyDuke (and in a more obvious manner than previously seen). Instead, we feel the targeting of drug dealers was a new task for a subset of the Dukes group, possibly due to the drug trade\u0027s relevance to security policy issues. It is therefore important to note that, contrary to what might be assumed, we have actually observed a drop instead of an increase in Ukraine-related campaigns from the Dukes following the country\u0027s political crisis. John Kasai of Klagenfurt, Austria During 2011, the Dukes appear to have significantly expanded both their arsenal of malware toolsets and their C\u0026C infrastructure. Much like the MiniDuke expose in February 2013, the Dukes again appeared to prioritize continuing operations over staying hidden. One might argue that since this took place after the exploits were publicly mentioned, the Dukes simply copied them. Right - Details for the domain were later changed, providing a small glimpse of the Dukes\u0027 sense of humor. The Dukes actively targeted Ukraine before the crisis, at a time when Russia was still weighing her options, but once Russia moved from diplomacy to direct action, Ukraine was no longer relevant to the Dukes in the same way. The Dukes continued the expansion of their arsenal in 2011 with the addition of two more toolsets: MiniDuke and CozyDuke. The Dukes have consistently operated large-scale campaigns against high-profile targets while concurrently engaging in smaller, more targeted campaigns with apparent coordination and no evidence of unintentional overlap or operational clashes. The Dukes primarily target Western governments and related organizations, such as government ministries and agencies, political think tanks, and governmental subcontractors. The Dukes rapidly react to research being published about their toolsets and operations. The earliest activity we have been able to definitively attribute to the Dukes are two PinchDuke campaigns from November 2008. The only instances which we are aware of where the Dukes did not use spear-phishing as the initial infection vector is with certain OnionDuke variants. The story of the Dukes, as it is currently known, begins with a malware toolset that we call PinchDuke. This does however still rule out the possibility that the Dukes simply obtained copies of the exploit binaries described by FireEye and repurposed them. This indication that the Dukes planned to use an arsenal of 5 malware toolsets in parallel suggests that they were operating with both significant resources and capacity. This paper has already stated that we believe the Dukes to be a Russian state-sponsored cyberespionage operation. This supports our analysis that the overarching theme in the Dukes\u0027 targeting is the collection of intelligence to support diplomatic efforts. This whitepaper explores the tools - such as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, etc- of the Dukes, a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized cyberespionage group that we believe has been working for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect intelligence in support of foreign and security policy decision-making. To spread the toolset, the Dukes used a wrapper to combine OnionDuke with legitimate applications, created torrent files containing these trojanized applications, then uploaded them to websites hosting torrent files (image 4, above). We also believe the tasking to have been temporary, because we have not observed any further similar targeting from the Dukes after the spring of 2014.

During this period of CosmicDuke testing and development, the Duke authors also started experimenting with the use of privilege escalation vulnerabilities. Further reading Timo Hirvonen; F-Secure Labs; CosmicDuke: Cosmu with a Twist of MiniDuke; published 2 July 2014; https://www.fsecure.com/ documents/996508/1030745/cosmicduke_ whitepaper.pdf GReAT; Securelist; Miniduke is back: Nemesis Gemina and the Botgen Studio; published 3 July 2014; https://securelist. com/blog/ incidents/64107/miniduke-is-back-nemesis- gemina-and-the-botgen-studio/ In addition to often embedding persistence or privilege escalation components, CosmicDuke has occasionally embedded PinchDuke, GeminiDuke, or MiniDuke components. It should be noted that until this point, even though CosmicDuke had been in active use for over 4 years, and had undergone minor modifications and updates during that time, even the most recent CosmicDuke samples would often embed persistence components that date back to 2012. Some hints about the history of the \u0027MiniDuke loader\u0027 were noted in the CosmicDuke whitepaper we published [5] in 2014, where we observed that the loader appeared to have been in use with CosmicDuke before it was used with MiniDuke. Specifically, the techniques CosmicDuke uses to extract user credentials from targeted software and to detect the presence of analysis tools appear to be based on the techniques used by PinchDuke. The emergence of CosmicDuke in the Caucasus The spring of 2010 saw continued PinchDuke campaigns against Turkey and Georgia, but also numerous campaigns against other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. They could have ceased all use of CosmicDuke (at least until they had developed a new loader) or retired it entirely, since they still had other toolsets available. We believe the purpose of this parallel use was to \u0027fieldtest\u0027 the new CosmicDuke tool, while at the same time ensuring operational success with the tried-and-tested PinchDuke. We however feel it is unlikely that the CosmicDuke operators targeting drug dealers and those targeting governments could be two entirely independent entities. While we believe CosmicDuke to be an entirely custom- written toolset with no direct sharing of code with other Duke toolsets, the high-level ways in which many of its features have been implemented appear to be shared with other members of the Duke arsenal.","gold":null}
{"query":"2013: CosmicDuke\u0027s war on drugs In a surprising turn of events, in September 2013 a CosmicDuke campaign was observed targeting Russian speakers involved in the trade of illegal and controlled substances (image 5, above). A few of the CosmicDuke samples we discovered also included components that attempt to exploit either of the publicly known CVE-2010-0232 or CVE-2010- 4398 privilege escalation vulnerabilities. After that, CosmicDuke and the second malware operate entirely independently of each other, including separately contacting their C\u0026C servers.
